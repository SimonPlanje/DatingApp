# Liking feature
Hello mate, 
Welcome to my dating feature. In the last couple of weeks I have been working on the liking part of a new dating feature. First I made the following jobstory to help me frame the problem I want to solve.

## Jobstory


## Installation
All of the content in this github repository is build from scratch with Node and vanilla javascript, I used mongodb so I can interact with a real and live database. 
So for the installation you will have to follow a few steps to get everything to work. 

1. Clone the files from the github repo and put them in an empty local file on your pc.
2. Open your Terminal/CMD and navigate to to the map where you pasted the copy of the repo in.
3. Now it is time to get this feature working, enter the following steps in your terminal.

This npm installation is required because this project contains a lot of the npm packages, without these packages this code will not work.
Type the following into your termial to install the npm packages:
```js
npm install
```

Now the server should start without any issues. 
To start the server type the following into your terminal:
```js
node index.js
```

Let check if the feature is up and running. 
The the following into you browser search bar:
```js
http://localhost:8090
```
